trackmaster
===========

Trackmaster is a series of RPG Tracking tools. It initially started out as just a way to pass a D&D game I could not participate in, but ended up including a few more useful tools.

Trackmaster is built with Angular, using yeoman and generator-angular.

Details to come, they are not exactly my thing.

Icons
==========
In order to generate an icon list (I haven't tested the app without at least one Icon, and it may break otherwise), just add PNGs to /icons


Todos
===========

* Tests (didn't make the tests, as this was just supposed to be a way to kill time)
* Fix Draggable Directive (Draggable is having trouble with Deleting)
